# Chef Support's Gather-Logs Tooling

We're pulling in tooling from the individual product repositories so there's a unified set of tooling to enable log gathering for Chef products. This will enable log submission when opening support tickets, but can also be used as part of a user's troubleshooting workflow with tools like [Chef's gatherlog report](https://github.com/chef/gatherlogs-reporter)

## Requirements

TBD

## Getting Started

Right now there's not much to be done, although if users have issues with existing `gather-logs` commands they can open an Issue against this repository and we'll try to address them as part of this ongoing work.
